                <div class="description">
                    <p>The Death Star will explode and Luke Skywalker has to get out of there as fast as possible.</p>

<p>To hinder his escape, droids are positioned at certain points of the star.</p>

<p>The star map is a rectangle composed only by empty spaces, walls and droids.</p>

<p>The droids don`t move and can shoot at straight line along its row and its column, but their shots cannot&nbsp;pass through walls.</p>

<p>As Luke is disarmed, he can`t defend shots and need to escape without entering the line of sight of any droid.</p>

<p>You must create a program to check if Luke escapes the star or not.</p>

                </div>

                <h2>Input</h2>

                <div class="input">
                    <p>The first line of input contains two integers n and m (2 &lt;= n, m &lt;= 100), indicating the height and width of the Death Star.</p>

<p>The next N lines have m characters each.</p>

<p>Empty cells are represented by the character '.' , cells with droids are represented by the character 'D' and walls are represented by '#'.</p>

<p>Luke begins at the upper left cell, and the exit of the Death Star is the lower right cell.</p>

<p>The point at which Luke begins and the exit of the star always contains empty cells.</p>

                </div>

                <h2>Output</h2>

                <div class="output">
                    <p>The output of the problem should be a single line containing:</p>

<p>The string "Run Luke, run", if he can escape from the star.</p>

<p>The string "May the force be with you", if he can not escape.</p>
